# Leap Year Checker
This program contains a function that determines if a year is a leap year, and a helper function to demonstrate it.

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

Solution (.sln) file is optional, I use it for working on multiple machines.
